Initial prototype. Basic movement with a divider in the middle

2/27
Removed the divider, and added walls with collisions. Changed FOV on both cameras to 110, character speed for both Black and White to 6, and camera speed to 0.11. Combined the Black and White specific scripts together; we now have a total of 3 scripts at the moment.
I also decided not to add in a time delay after running into walls for two reasons (one it was very complicated, two, it didn't seem too fun after I tried out a semi-working version). If anything, maybe we could add it back in later, but I don't think we need to (I have a feeling the game will be hard enough).
Note: There are a lot of walls at the moment that are just border walls. I'm not sure exactly how we'll handle the wall situation later, but what I have now is just temporary.
